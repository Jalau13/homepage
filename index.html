    <h2 class="header"> About Me <h2>
      <p> Currently I am technically unemployed due to COVID-19.  I worked as a flight attendant for a major US airline
      back in March, but was subsequently laid off due to 0 travel demand in the industry.  So, I've decided to try my
      hand at learning some programming skills via Harvard's CS50x course on the Edx platform. </p>

      <p> So far, I have tried learning programming concepts in C, transitioned into a bit of Python, and learned
      to query data with SQL.  Now I'm currently working on my CSS, HTML and Javascript ablities and see if I can create
      something nice.  On this website, I will try to post things that I like; travel stories from my time
      as a flight attendant, favorite recipes or eateries for food.  That seems like a good start.  If you're stil reading
      this, welcome!  And I hope you find something interesting while you're poking around! </p>
